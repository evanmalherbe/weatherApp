## Instructions
These were the instructions I was given to guide me in this task:

**Follow these steps:**
* Create a React app that will display the weather in a city of the userâ€™s choice. The user should be able to enter or select the name of the city that they would like to see the weather for.
* Use the OpenWeatherMap API: https://openweathermap.org/current . Consult the documentation of the API for instructions.

### Technologies
This project uses:
* HTML 5 
* CSS 3
* Javascript ECMAScript 2021
* React
* React Bootstrap

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, do the following:
1. Copy the directory called 'weatherapp' to your local machine.
2. Navigate to this directory from the command line interface. E.g. cd c:/weatherapp.
3. In the command line interface type 'npm install'
4. Once it has finished installing, type 'npm start'. This runs the app in the development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage 
To use this app, simply type in the name of a city that you want to know the current weather conditions in, (e.g. Cape Town), and click the "Get Weather" button. The resulting information will be displayed underneath. See figure 1 below.
